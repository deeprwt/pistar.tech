                      At PiStarTech, we are committed to enhancing healthcare
                      with innovative solutions that bridge the gap between
                      technology and medical practice. Our flagship product, the
                      Diabetic PodiaScan Mat (DiaPS Mat), is an advanced,
                      research-backed foot pressure analysis system designed to
                      support medical professionals in diagnosing and treating
                      foot-related ailments, particularly for diabetic patients.
                      <br />
                      The DiaPS Mat is a portable and flexible pressure-sensing
                      mat that provides both static and dynamic podiatric
                      pressure patterns (SPPP and DPPP). These insights help
                      doctors detect normal and abnormal foot posture, track
                      patient recovery post-injury or surgery, and authenticate
                      clinical findings with accurate, quantifiable data. With
                      just a 5-second scan, healthcare professionals can
                      prescribe customized treatments, recommend proper
                      footwear, and monitor progress over time.
                      <br />
                      Our mission is to make affordable, precise, and
                      evidence-based foot scanning technology accessible to a
                      wider range of medical professionals, empowering them to
                      provide better care. Whether you're looking to improve
                      diagnosis accuracy, enhance patient trust through
                      cutting-edge technology, or monitor patient progress
                      post-surgery, PiStarTech has you covered.
